# EXAMPLE CONFIGURATION
# Rename this file to "config.yml" before you start Tytanium.

storage:
  # If there is another directory you want to save files to (instead of "files" in the executable's
  # directory), then specify an absolute path here.
  directory:
security:
  # The key to upload.
  masterkey:
  # Max size (in bytes) a file can be. This is 50 MiB.
  # There will always be 2048 bytes added on top of this so that the server can respond. If it were 0 bytes,
  # the server would not be able to respond at all LOL
  maxsizebytes: 52428800
  # Key not required to upload if this is true.
  # Enable this if you know what you're doing.
  publicmode: false
  ratelimit:
    # When to reset the limit, in milliseconds.
    # The default value here is 1 minute.
    resetafter: 60000
    # Handles /upload path alone.
    # This default value, for example, allows 10 uploads per minute.
    # If not specified there will be no rate limit for the upload path.
    upload: 10
    # This is the GLOBAL rate limit.
    # All requests to the server are limited to this number, per minute.
    # If a per-route rate limit exceeds this number it will be overridden by this number.
    # If not specified a rate limit will not exist.
    global: 20
  bandwidthlimit:
    # When to reset the limit, in milliseconds.
    # Wait 5 minutes before resetting the limit.
    resetafter: 300000
    # How many bytes an IP address can download/upload in the above resetafter time.
    # These default values are downloa 50 MB in 5 minutes or upload 250 MB in 5 minutes.
    # If they're not specified it will be ignored.

    upload: 262144000
  # A subset of mime type lists which change how files can be displayed.
  filter:
    # A list of mime types to block from loading completely.
    # If no values are given, a blacklist will not be set.
    # This default list blocks unknown file types and unwanted files (typically), mainly applications.
    blacklist:
      - application/octet-stream
      - application/vnd.microsoft.portable-executable

    # If this list is populated, then Tytanium will ONLY allow these mime types to be displayed.
    # If a mime type from this list is also in the sanitize list, it will be sanitized.
    # If a mime type from this list is also in the blacklist, it will be blacklisted anyway.
    # If no values are given, a whitelist will not be set.
    whitelist:
    # A list of mime types to render as text/plain. Effective against documents like HTML to prevent phishing.
    # If no values are given, no mime types will be sanitized.
    sanitize:

  # This default value gives 62^8 possible values, and should be good enough.

  # How many TOTAL requests the server can handle at once.
  # Requests will not be served to ANYONE if the # of connections everywhere is above this number.
