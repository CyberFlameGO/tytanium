# -----------------------
# EXAMPLE CONFIGURATION
# -----------------------

# Rename this file to "config2.yml" before you start Tytanium,
# or copy the contents of this file to a file named "config2.yml"
# that you made beforehand.

storage: # Configure options relating to file storage.
  # If there is another directory you want to save files to (instead of "files" in the executable's
  # directory), then specify an absolute path here.
  directory:
  # The size (in bytes) a file can be. This is 50 MiB.
  # There will always be 2048 bytes added on top of this so that the server can respond. If it were 0 bytes,
  # the server would not be able to respond at all LOL
  maxsize: 52428800
  # The ID length to use. (e.g: xxxxx.png has an ID length of 5).
  # IDs are composed of alphanumeric characters only (A-Z, a-z, 0-9).
  # This default value gives 62^8 possible values, and should be good enough for most settings.
  idlen: 8
  # How many times an ID should be checked to see if a duplicate exists.
  collisioncheckattempts: 3

ratelimit: # Limit the amount of requests users are allowed to make.
  # When to reset the rate limit imposed on a user, in milliseconds. The default value here is 1 minute.
  resetafter: 60000
  # Handles the /upload path alone. This means that the rate limit for this path is exclusive to the path only.
  # This default value, for example, allows 10 uploads per minute. If it is exceeded, the user can still access
  # the rest of the site, but will not be allowed to upload until the rate limit is reset.
  # If not specified there will be no rate limit for the upload path.
  upload: 10
  # This is the GLOBAL rate limit.
  # All requests to the server are limited to this number, per minute.
  # If a per-route rate limit exceeds this number it will be overridden by this number.
  # If not specified a rate limit will not exist.
  global: 20
  bandwidth: # Limit the amount of data IPs can download/upload.
    # When to reset the limit, in milliseconds. This default value is 5 minutes.
    resetafter: 300000
    # How many bytes an IP address can download/upload in the allotted time frame (specified by resetafter).
    # These default values are download 50 MB in 5 minutes or upload 250 MB in 5 minutes.
    # If they are not specified there will be no restrictions on bandwidth.
    download: 52428800
    upload: 262144000

filter: # Configure which file types are allowed to be uploaded.
  # A list of mime types to block from loading completely.
  # If no values are given, a blacklist will not be set.
  # This default list blocks unknown file types and unwanted files (typically), mainly applications.
  blacklist:
    - application/octet-stream
    - application/vnd.microsoft.portable-executable
    - application/x-msdos-program
    - application/x-executable
    - application/x-sqlite3
    - application/x-object
    - application/x-elf
  # If this list is populated, then Tytanium will ONLY allow these mime types to be displayed.
  # If a mime type from this list is also in the sanitize list, it will be sanitized.
  # If a mime type from this list is also in the blacklist, it will be blacklisted anyway.
  # If no values are given, a whitelist will not be set.
  whitelist:
  # A list of mime types to render as text/plain. Effective against documents like HTML to prevent phishing.
  # If no values are given, no mime types will be sanitized. It is highly recommended you at least keep text/html.
  sanitize:
    - text/html
    - text/x-php
    - application/javascript
    - application/x-python
    - text/x-lua
    - text/x-perl

security: # Options relating to security and authorization.
  # The key to upload. Do not share it with people you do not know and trust.
  masterkey:

server: # Configure the way the HTTP server runs.
  # What port to listen on. The default is 3030.
  port:
  # How many TOTAL requests the server can handle at once.
  # Requests will not be served to ANYONE if the # of simultaneous connections is above this number.
  concurrency: 512

redis: # Configure the Redis connection.
  uri:
  password:
  db: 0

morestats: # A boolean for if you want to have /stats show more data, including memory usage.
